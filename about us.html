                    <p>Bestari Jaya (Batang Berjuntai) is a small town in Selangor, Malaysia. It is located in the district of Kuala Selangor
                        The name Batang Berjuntai in Chinese does not mean anything wrong, but the meaning in Bahasa Malaysia is indecent.
                        "Batang Berjuntai" is a term in the Malay language. It is used because the area has a railway line between Batang Berjuntai and Batu Arang and on to the main route of the Malay Railway in Kuang. The road between the town and Batu Arang was destroyed by Japanese soldiers throughout the Second World War and was never rebuilt.
                        Batang means a wooden stick, dangling means something that is swaying. The combination means "stem that is swaying".
                        It is believed that the name of the village comes from a tree that is about to fall and is dangling. It is said that the tree finally fell after hanging for a long time.
                        The book Places Names In Peninsular Malaysia states that the tree is always swaying even without the wind blowing</p></div>

                    <p>The earliest Malays to set foot in Batang Berjuntai are said to have lived close to the tree. Finally they named this place as Batang Berjuntai.
                        Although the above assumption is just a legend, it is always mentioned in the local community.
                        By 2007, the Selangor state government had changed the name Batang Berjuntai to Bestari Jaya after considering that the original meaning was indecent.
                        Batang Berjuntai is a remote village on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. However, this place was an important tin mining and farming area 100 years ago.</p></div>
